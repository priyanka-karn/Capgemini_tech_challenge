# Capgemini_tech_challenge
  
The  challenge  is  to  build   a ' Product Recommendation Engine '  of  two  datasets  which  is given - Electronics  and  Modcloth  Datasets.                                       

For  this  problem , you  have to first install  some packages/libraries  like  numpy,scikit-learn, scipy, pandas.You  can  use  any editor for coding. I have  used  Jupyter Notebook.
